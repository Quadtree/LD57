Try to drive your chariot through the depths while collecting kelp and gems. Your inflatable head can control buoyancy, but steering the chariot may become difficult if the weight is unbalanced. Also, watch out for sharks.

Controls:
- W/S or Up/Down: Increase/Decrease buoyancy
- A/D or Left/Right: Have the fish pulling the chariot move left or right
- Left click: Grab an item or ward off an attacker
- Ctrl+R: Restart level
