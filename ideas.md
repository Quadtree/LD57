- Some kind of physics-based game where you're driving a submarine
- You're the kraken. Attack from the depths!
- 3d exploration game where you wander through tunnels in a minisub
- 2d game where you try to thread your diving hose into some kind of underwater wreck or something
- Sorta like barotrauma

- Where you're some kind of salvager who attaches baloons to things
- You're a squid driving an underwater chariot. You've got to get your seahorses to go the right direction while maintaining bouyancy.
  - How do you lose?
	- Too much damage from shark attacks
	- Too much collision damage (especially if the chariot flips over)
